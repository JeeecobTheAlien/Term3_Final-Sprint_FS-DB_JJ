# Term3_Final-Sprint_FS-DB_JJ
This is my Full Stack and my Data Base Final Sprint for Term 3 of the SD9 Cohort. Participants in the following assignment are Me, Myself, and I. being done by one person doesn't mean it'll be functional but in two is weeks ill most certainly try!

The Website being developed is a Car Registry with realistic data for the cars along with some personal favorites and some easter eggs since its around easter and all.

Been doing vehicle related assignments all semester and wanted to do something along the lines that I want to fully use in the future so I decided to try and create it for my final assignment as I've already had a similar version started as a personal project!
