The inclusion of the text file is just a continuation to the 
4 question asked in the QAP' in my own personal view
-------------------------------------------------------------

1: How long did it take you - Well I've put in 8-12 hours per day starting Wednesday Apr, 3rd but Saturday April, 6th I spent 14 hours cleaning and troubleshooting and configuring code, 
                              (Sunday no work was completed as that was a sleep all day, day) all working code was uploaded in my updates via github!

2: What online resources did you use - Co-Pilot, Co-Pilot more Co-Pilot and a bit of GPT I also watched a few lectures regarding the Databases and Tokens while watching YouTube.

3: Did you need to ask any friends for help - No I done this completely alone with help from an instructor

4: Did you need to ask any instructors for help - Yes for an hour from Jordan

5: Rate the level of difficulty - Well I understand why its supposed to be done in groups because it probably wouldnt have been so time consuming to do it on my own but, 
                                  to do it on my own at least I didnt have to wait on anyone to upload a code to get working if needed so rating wise, (1 being easy - 10 being hard)
                                  I'd say an 8, Would I do another sprint like this alone? Not under the same circumstances maybe a longer time period for a personal idea!
